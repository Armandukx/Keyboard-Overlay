# Important ⚠️
- Ensure that no open application contains the name "Keyboard Overlay"; otherwise, OBS/Other Software will capture that one and not the actual file.
- If the application opens and then closes, it means it's updating or has been updated.
  - If the application does not open after the update, something may have gone wrong. Please reach out to armandukxreal@gmail.com with the error.
